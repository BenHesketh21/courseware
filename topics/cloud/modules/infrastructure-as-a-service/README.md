# Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)

IaaS is a computing infrastructure that can be provisioned and managed over the internet. 
You pay for what you use and IaaS allows quick scaling up or down of the infrastructure. 
Once of the main lucrative reasons that attract companies in moving onto it is that the burden of buying and managing
 physical servers and other infrastructure required to have it on premises is eliminated. 
Each service component is a different service altogether, allowing you to use the specific resources that you require
 and as long as you need them for. 
There are three main IaaS providers:
* Google Cloud Platform
* Amazon Web Services
* Microsoft Azure

A cloud provider you would be using takes the responsibility for the infrastructure while you are still responsible for:
* Software
    * Installing
    * Configuration
    * Management
* Middleware
* Applications

In the following picture we can see the responsibilities of the vendor and client when comparing IaaS against On
 Premises hosting.
