# TCP
## Overview
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-orientated.
This means that there is a handshake to ensure that the data has been delivered correctly.
A logical connection must be established before any transferring of data can begin, TCP uses a 3 way handshake when establishing and terminating a connection, more on this in the TCP operation section.
The reliable nature of TCP means that is it used application level protocols such as SSH, FTP and almost anything where all of the data must be transferred.

## TCP Header Format
Every TCP header has ten required fields and an optional 11th field.
This many fields are needed in a TCP header because TCP has quite a few capabilities compared to a protocol such as UDP.

1. Source Port – The port from which the packet was sent from
2. Destination Port – The port of the receiving device
3. Sequence Number – The device sending the packets will use sequence numbers to order groups of messages, for instance an image file that is being transported over multiple messages will need to be reconstructed at the other end in the correct order.
4. Acknowledgement Number – Both the senders and receivers of the messages will use the acknowledgement numbers field to communicate the sequence numbers of the messages that have either been recently received or expected to be sent.
5. Data Offset – Stores the total size of the header
6. Reserved – These are 3 bits for the reserved field. They are unused and are always set to 0.
7. Control Flags – There are six standard and three extended control flags that are used for managing the data flow, more on this in the TCP operation section.
8. Window Size – A way of regulating how much data can be sent before requiring an acknowledgement to confirm that the data has been received successfully.
9. Checksum – Generated by the sender, a mathematical technique for the receiver to assure the integrity of the data and make sure that it has not been corrupted or tampered with.
10. Urgent Pointer – This value is typically set to zero and ignored, however it can be used in conjunction with one of the control flags to require priority in processing.
11. Optional Data – Optional data for TCP allow more features such as support for special types of acknowledgement and window scaling algorithms
