## Overview
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool.
It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. 

## Installation
### Pip
A good way to install Ansible is by using the `pip` package manager.
This is because to run Ansible on any machine you are going to need Python installed.
With Python installed the Pip package manager is a consistent way to install Ansible on any machine.

We can also use Pip to install Ansible into the current user's home directory aswell - avoiding any need for elevated permissions on the machine.
